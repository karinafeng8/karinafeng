## About Me
I am a 2023 graduate from Columbia University with a degree in Psychology. My research focuses on well-being, exploring how built, social, and natural environments shape people’s experiences, social interactions, and overall life satisfaction. I am particularly interested in how demographic changes in environments—at both micro and macro levels—affect well-being over time.

Throughout my academic journey, I have contributed to studies on life satisfaction across racial groups in U.S. counties, the impact of demographic shifts on implicit and explicit biases, and the effects of location and social schema retraining on memory recall. I have developed a broad skillset in advanced statistical techniques, including compositional data analysis (CoDA), multilevel modeling, and natural language processing (NLP), often working with large, nationally representative datasets. My research bridges psychology with data science, political science, and sociology to address both community-level and individual outcomes.

I aspire to advance well-being research to inform evidence-based policies for governments and organizations. I believe population-level research can guide the creation of social policies that account for individual well-being needs. How can we build happier workplaces, homes, and communities? I am also curious about time use—particularly the relationship between alone time and well-being—and how people perceive and reflect on their alone time versus experiences of loneliness. My approach emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration and transparency to drive meaningful research outcomes.

Originally from Oklahoma, I now live in New York City, where I moved to pursue my undergraduate degree. Outside of research, I enjoy exploring new cities, photography, and discovering great food!
